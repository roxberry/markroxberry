This plugin is a really simple way to add the Google Latitude "Where Am I" badge code as part of your sidebars.

== Description ==

This plugin is a really simple way to add the Google Latitude "Where Am I" badge code as part of your sidebars. V1.03 fixes a trailing Anchor tag that wasn't closed properly. In addition, thanks to Dennis Wu (http://denniswu.com/) and Phil Bridges (http://philbridges.com/) for helping to find that SOME users will have a "-" in front of their Latitude id.

== Installation ==

You will need to do the following to make this work

1) Download this plugin

2) Go to http://www.google.com/latitude/apps/badge

 a) change your Google Latitude "Settings" to one of the two "enable" settings.

 b) copy the number after "user=" in the displayed script **WARNING** Some users will be a negative number. If you leave out the "-" it will fail. *****

3) Upload this plugin to your Wordpress installation. 

4) Go to WP-Admin, Appearance, Widgets, and add the widget to your sidebar of choice.

  a) Edit the widget settings to your tastes - ESPECIALLY the Google Latitude ID (unless you're stalking TheITJuggler :)

5) That's it on Wordpress. 

6) Go to the device that will be your "Latitude locater" device.

7) Change your privacy settings to be anything OTHER than "Hide Your Location".

8) That's it.
